# qooxdoo developer manual

## About

This manual is a technical manual for qooxdoo core developers. Its scope is
how certain things within the project - both code and procedures - are
implemented, so that another (or a new) core developer can get informed about
these things easily, when code and comments are not enough. So the information
herein is valuable, but doesn't suit the normal user manual, as it concerns
things the normal user of qooxdoo doesn't have to deal with.

If you find that some information should be in this manual, open a bug for
creating it.

The manual is revision-controlled so changes to the information herein over time
reflect the changes in the project, but earlier states can be inspected or
recovered if necessary.
