# qooxdoo team membership

Membership on the qooxdoo team is by invitation. Acceptance onto the qooxdoo
team requires approval of 100% of the existing team membership.

A member may be removed from the team with the approval of all team members
except the one proposed to be removed.

## Code Owners

There may be times when it is desirable to have a member on the team who is
not available to, or qualified to, approve commits to the source code
repository. The list of voting members on commits is maintained in the file 
.github/CODEOWNERS. When a new member is accepted to the team, he or she will
by default not be listed in the CODEOWNERS file.

Adding or removing a member to the CODEOWNERS file requires approval of all
existing team members, exclusive of the member being considered for inclusion
in CODEOWNERS.
