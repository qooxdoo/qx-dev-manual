# Migration Data #

*(status: Not yet updated for 6.0 release)*

This section deals with creating and maintaining migration data, usually found under ``tool/data/migration``.

## Folder Structure ##

Here is a representation of the folder structure of the migration data. Under
the root folder for the migration data there are version folders for specific
qooxdoo releases. Each version folder contains ``info`` and ``patches``
subdirectories, which in turn contain data files for regex-base reporting or
1. Additionally, there might be Python scripts ``patch.py`` or
   ``config.py`` for tree-based code transformation and configuration file
   migration, respectively.  The meaning of the different files and folders are
   explained in the remainder of this document. Most of them are optional.


<dl>
  <dt>      tool/data/migration/</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>tool/data/migration/</p>
    <p>+- 2.1.1/                   [version number]</p>
    <p>+- info/</p>
    <p>+- 01-main.dat          [name arbitrary, but must end with .dat]</p>

    <p>+- config.json</p>

    <p>+- config.py</p>
  </dd>

- It is not mandatory to add a migration folder for any given release. If there
  is no migration necessary for a release, there is no need to add a
  folder with its version string.
- But for every version you add you need to adapt ``tool/bin/migrator.py``, the
  script that actually preforms the migration. Add the new version to its list
  of known %{qooxdoo} versions, in the order they should be performed. You
  might also want to adjust the default old version.


## Regex Targeting %{JS} Code ##

The most common actions migrating one version to another are regex-based. Files
in the ``info`` folder are to provide helpful messages based on a match of their
regular expressions. They only produce log output. This is helpful if we cannot
provide automatic migration, e.g. when the meaning of a method parameter has
changed and the user needs to check whether he passes the correct values when
calling the method.

Files in the ``patches`` folder are to replace matches with new
1. They actually change class code. This is helpful for string-based
   replacements in the code, e.g. when a framework class has gotten a new name
   while retaining all its old methods and semantics, like ``qx.foo.OldName`` ->
   ``qx.bar.NewName``.


### Info Files ###

#### How they are processed ####

The patterns from all info files are applied to each class file that is to be migrated. If a
pattern matches, its associated message is logged.

#### File syntax ####

Each info file consists of a number of lines. Each line consists of a regular
expression pattern, a ``=``, and a message string. If a ``=`` is part of the
##### pattern, it has to be escaped like ``\=``. The first occurrence of an unescaped #####

will be used to split the line, so subsequent unescaped ``=`` in the
<dl>
  <dt>message do no harm. Example :  : </dt>
  <dd>\bqx\.bom\.Collection\b='qx.bom.Collection' is deprecated. Please check out the class qxWeb instead.</dd>
</dl>
### Patch Files ###

#### How they are processed ####

The patterns from all patch files are applied to each class file that is to be
1. If a pattern matches, the matched source string is replaced by the
   pattern's associated replacement string. The changed content is written to the
   class file, replacing its original content.


#### File syntax ####

Each patch file consists of a number of lines. Each line consists of a regular
expression pattern, a ``=``, and a replacement string. If a ``=`` is part of the
##### pattern, it has to be escaped like ``\=``. The first occurrence of an unescaped #####

will be used to split the line, so subsequent unescaped ``=`` in the
replacement do no harm. In the replacement you can use capture groups from the
<dl>
  <dt>pattern matching with ``\1``, ``\2`` asf. Example :  : </dt>
  <dd>\bqx\.lang\.Array\.toArray\((.*?)\)=qx.lang.Array.cast(\1, Array)</dd>
</dl>
## Python Script Targeting %{JS} Code ##

There is the possibility to use a Python script that works on the syntax tree of
1. source file, in order to obtain more complicated rewrites than could be
   achieved with regex's. (One example would be working on an argument of a method
   call, in between parentheses, that is itself an expression containing
2. In such a case it is not possible to match the closing parenthesis
   of the method call with a regex reliably.)


The script's file name has to be ``patch.py``. It must contain a
method ``patch(fileId, parseTree)`` which takes a file id and a syntax tree, and
must change the syntax tree in place. It must return ``True`` or ``False``
depending on whether the tree has been changed.  During the migration process
tree-based transformations, if available, are applied *before* regex-based
1. The changed tree is written to disk using the Generator's
   pretty-printing feature, in place of the original file content.


### Caveats ###

- An important thing to note is that although the ``patch.py`` module of a
  specific %{qooxdoo} version is written against the tool chain *as it were at
  that time*, the module is actually run with the tool chain *of the target
  version*. That means that migrating from, say, version 2.0 to 2.3, a
  ``patch.py`` in the 2.1 version is run with the 2.3 SDK.
- That means that changes in the tool chain after the introduction of a specific
  ``patch.py`` (changed syntax tree, changed interface between *migrator.py*
  and *patch.py* etc.) will most likely break the patch.py module.
- It would be ideal to run each ``patch.py`` with the tool chain it was created
   1. But that would require the user to download all intervening SDKs :-(.

- So if compatibility with older ``patch.py`` modules breaks, one possibility is
  to require the user to first migrate to the last version which is known to
  work with those patch files (needing this particular intervening SDK), and
  then migrate to the final version. (We did something before, probably for
  other reasons, for applications being migrated from a version lower than 0.8
  to something greater than 0.8, requiring an intermediate migration to 0.8.2.)


### How to do it ###

- Create a file ``patch.py`` in the version folder of the migration data, i.e.
  at the same level as the ``info`` and ``patch`` folders.
- Add a function ``def patch(fileId, parseTree)`` to the file that will be
  passed the syntax tree of a class file and may make arbitrary changes to the
  tree.
- The function has to return ``True/False`` to indicate whether it has made
  changes to the tree. Example of a correct do-nothing patch function:

  <dl>
    <dt>   def patch(fileId, parseTree) : </dt>
    <dd>
      <p>def patch(fileId, parseTree):</p>
    <p>return False</p>
  </dd>
  </dl>

## Python Script Targeting Configuration Files ##

- The basic logic for migrating configuration files is implemented.
- The main missing thing is the handling of ``=`` (don't overwrite) sigils in
  config keys, like ``{"=foo" : {"bar":1}}``. It is unclear how they should be
  handled in a concrete config if the corresponding key is to be moved or
  renamed.


### How to do it ###

- Copy ``config.py`` from ``tool/data/migration/1.6`` folder to the current version folder. If unchanged, it does nothing so the copy is harmless.
- Read the comments in the file and fill out the indicated data structures and functions. Only then will the script be active when a ``generate.py migration`` is run.
