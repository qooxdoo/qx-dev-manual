# qooxdoo developer manual

[Entry page](Home.md)

## Purpose

This is the qooxdoo developer manual ("dev-manual"), outlining the process of
how the [qooxdoo project](http://github.com/qooxdoo/qooxdoo) is managed.
The dev-manual builds on the earlier [qooxdoo wiki](http://github.com/qooxdoo/qooxdoo/wiki)
established by @derrell. It has been decided to keep developer information as
a simple repository of markdown pages, since wiki pages cannot be version-
controlled easily.

## Proposing changes

In order to maintain the integrity of the manual, it is edited collaboratively
in this repository. If you want to make changes, please adhere to the following
procedure:

- Fork this repository
- Make your edits
- Issue a pull request to the upstream repository
